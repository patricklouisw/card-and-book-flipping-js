## Explanation of Library

All the code for the library is in lib.js

We focus on 3 functionality for this release:

1. Card Flipping by Clicking
2. Card Flipping by Hovering
3. 3D Book Animation
4. Add or Remove "Flip Click" cards or "Flip Hover" cards

From now until the last deadline, I will develop on:

1. Clicking on book to zoom in to the book and read the book. (Pages can turn and You can read the book online.)
