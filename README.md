My Express app ran into an error:

"Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 'C:\Users\Patrick Louis\Desktop\CSC309\individual_project\index.html'"

To view my sample application, please click "./pub/index.html".

If there's an error, please run index.html in a server, by pressing "Go Live" in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

## Explanation of Library

All the code for the library is in lib.js

We focus on 3 functionality for this release:

1. Card Flipping by Clicking
2. Card Flipping by Hovering
3. 3D Book Animation

From now until the last deadline, I will develop on:

1. Clicking on book to zoom in to the book and read the book. (Pages can turn and You can read the book online.)
2. More Animations.
